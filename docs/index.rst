Welcome to Mailthon
===================

Welcome to Mailthon's documentation. Mailthon is an email library for
Python that aims to be highly extensible and composable. The docs are
divided into different parts. I suggest that you start with :ref:`installation`
and then head to the :ref:`quickstart`. If you want to dive into the
internals, go for the :ref:`api` section.
